# Autonomous-Robot-Project

In this project it is applied concept of Artificial Intelligence in a mobile robot differential drive.
The main idea is to use the open source TensorFlow Object Detection API to implement the object detection in a mobile robot controlled by RaspberryPi

The model used is pretrained and then trained to detected few objects.
