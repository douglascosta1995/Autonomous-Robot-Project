# Autonomous-Robot-Project

In this project it is applied concept of Artificial Intelligence in a mobile robot differential drive.
The main idea is to use the open source TensorFlow Object Detection API to implement the object detection in a mobile robot controlled by RaspberryPi

The model used is pretrained and then trained to detected few objects.

Below it is shown the main libraries and versions used for this project:
tensorflow==2.4.0
opencv-python==4.5.3.56
tf_slim==1.1.0
pycocotools==2.0.2
lvis==0.5.3
tf-models-official==2.4.0
scipy==1.4.1
